    * Selectors in CSS
        1. Simple Selector
            1.1 Element Selector / Type Selector / Tag Selector
            1.2 Class Selector
            1.3 ID Selector
        2. Pseudo-Class Selector
        3. Multiple Selector / Grouping Selector

    Selector:- It is a way using which we can select an element(s)
-->

<!-- 
    Element Selector: CSS can select HTML elements by using an element's tag name. A tag name is the word(or character) between HTML angle brackets.

    Class Selector: CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute. To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period(.) must be prepended to the class's name

    Id Selector: For situations where you need more specificity in styling, you may also select elements for CSS using an id attribute. You can have different ids associated with a class (although a class is not required). The id attribute can be added to an element, along with a class attribute. On the CSS side, the delineation is made by using # to represent an id, the same way . is used for class.

    ? Pseudo-classes Selector
    A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected elements(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

    ? Multiple Selector / Grouping Selector
    What if we want to add some styles to all our headings? We don't want to have redundant rules, since that would eventually become a nightmare to maintain and is not scalable at all. Instead, we can select multiple HTML elements in the same CSS rule by separating them with commas. Copying and pasting code us usually a bad idea for web developers, and multiple selectors can help reduce that kind of behavior quite a bit.
