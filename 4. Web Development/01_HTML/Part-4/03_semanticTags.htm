            <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,[6] the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and soldier Toivo Karanko. His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority in Finland. <br/> <br/> His interest in computers began with a VIC-20[8] at the age of 11 in 1981. He started programming for it in BASIC, then later by directly accessing the 6502 CPU in machine code (he did not utilize assembly language).[9] He then purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland", he wrote his own assembler and editor "(in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)"[10] for the QL, and a few games.[11][12] He wrote a Pac-Man clone, Cool Man. <br/> <br/> Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki from 1988 to 1996,[13] graduating with a master's degree in computer science from the NODES research group.</p>
